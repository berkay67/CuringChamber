# CuringChamber

Simple Arduino project to control the on/off state of a fridge, humidifier, air dryer and/or fans to keep in certain levels for meat curing and thus creating a very crude curing chamber.

#ToDo List:
- Adjust the write function to register the set values for temperature and humidity (make it store a string instead?)
- Function to write logs (reboot, errors, etc)
- Function to parse parameters from SDCard (https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=210904.0)
- Solve problem of seconds not being sent properly when calling functions
- Adjust the error message onto the debugSDcard functions
- Create some sketch to be displayed at the description of this project
